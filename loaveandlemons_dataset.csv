Pulse until the butter is well combined with the flour and the dough starts to form clumps. There should be no dry flour remaining.
Spread the mixture evenly in the bowl of the food processor and sprinkle the remaining ½ cup flour on top. Briefly pulse until the dough becomes crumbly.

I also like to dust the top of the dough with flour and flip it over a few times during the rolling process.
To transfer the rolled-out dough to the prepared baking sheet, roll the dough over your rolling pin and unroll it onto the baking sheet. Spread the goat cheese mixture in the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Arrange the tomato slices on top and fold the edges of the dough over the edges of the tomatoes, leaving the center of the filling exposed. Brush the crust with the egg wash.

Place your knife across the mango lengthwise, slightly left of the pit in the center. Slice downward to cut the side of the mango off the pit. Repeat the same motion on the other side.
Score each mango side: Set the pit aside, and place one of the mango sides skin-side-down on the cutting board. Use your knife to score the mango flesh in a grid pattern, cutting down to the skin but not through it. Use your fingers to invert the skin and flatten it against the cutting board.
Slice off the mango flesh: Slice laterally across the scored mango side to separate the mango cubes from the skin. Repeat the scoring and slicing process with the other side.
Enjoy the mango on its own, or add it to any recipe that calls for diced mango."

Matcha Glaze: In a small doughnut-sized bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and matcha powder, then whisk in the almond milk until smooth. Dip each doughnut in the glaze and let the excess glaze drip off.
Matcha Cane Sugar: In a small doughnut-sized bowl, mix the cane sugar and matcha powder. Add the melted coconut oil to a separate bowl and dip both sides of each doughnut first into the coconut oil, and then into the sugar mixture. The coconut oil helps the sugar adhere and it also produces the most fried-doughnut-like taste.
Matcha Powdered Sugar: In a small doughnut-sized bowl, mix together the powdered sugar and matcha powder. Dip both sides of each doughnut into the sugar, tapping off any excess."

½ teaspoon lemon juice
Pinch of salt

2 tablespoons chia seeds
Maple syrup
Granola
Coconut Cream (from this recipe)","Make the jam. In a small saucepan over medium heat, simmer the strawberries, rhubarb, lemon juice, and salt for 10 minutes, stirring often so that the fruit doesn't burn to the bottom of the pot. Remove from the heat and stir in the maple syrup and chia seeds. Let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes (the rhubarb will continue to soften). Transfer to a jar and chill for at least an hour.
Make the oats. Divide the oats into 2 glass jars, pour in the almond milk, a pinch of salt, and maple syrup, if desired. Stir, cover, and chill overnight.
In the morning, assemble oat jars with a generous scoop of the chia jam.
If desired, serve with granola, (the crunch is a nice contrast to the soft oats), maple syrup for extra sweetness, and coconut cream if you’re feeling like a decadent breakfast."

Poke a few holes in the top of the squash and roast until it’s soft and a fork easily slides in and out. About 45 minutes. Let squash cool then scoop the flesh out from the skin and discard the skin.

For the bars:: Line an 8x8 (or similar size) baking dish with parchment paper. In a food processor pulse together the flour, walnuts, brown sugar, butter and salt until it becomes crumbly. (Similar to the texture of wet sand). If the crumble is too dry, add a few drops of water and pulse again.

Spread the squash puree evenly over the pre-baked crust. Top with chocolate chips, shredded coconut and the remainder of the crumble mixture. (Optional: bake 10-15 minutes more to toast the topping and melt the chocolate).

1 cup lightly sweet white wine (I used a Viognier)
7 dried pequin chile peppers, stems removed
3 Granny Smith apples (or pectin)
¼ cup lemon juice
Zest from 1 small lemon (about 1 tablespoon)","Peel: Cut a small ""x"" into the bottom of each peach, drop it into boiling water for a minute or two (you'll know when it's ready when you see the skin start to separate near the ""x""), remove, and then drop into an ice bath. Once the peach is cool enough to handle, slip the skin off. I've also found that the ease of removing peach skins really depends on the ripeness of the fruit and how it's been grown. If the peach is overripe or underripe, it always seems like it's much harder (sometimes impossible) to remove the skins. In that case, I just cut the skin away.
Cut and mix: Add a little sugar into the bottom of a medium-sized glass (or non-metal, non-reactive) bowl. Slice each peach in half, top to bottom, and remove the pit. Cut each half into 12-16 thin slices and add to the bowl. Between each peach, add a little more sugar until you've added all the peaches and all the sugar. Then add the wine and the chiles and stir gently until combined.
Macerate (2-3 days): Let the mixture sit in the fridge for at least two days (and up to three). If you want a little extra kick, try this: on the second day, simmer the mixture again, allow to cool, and transfer back to the bowl and let it sit in the fridge for one more day. (This will infuse more spice into your jam).
Cook: (If you're canning, start preparing your boiling water bath, jars, and lids now). Pour the peach mixture into a colander suspended over a bowl and strain the juices. Transfer the juices to a preserving pan or a heavy-bottomed, wide, deep, non-reactive, uncoated sauté pan. Add the lemon juice to the pan. Cut the apples into quarters and either add straight to the pan or bundle in a cheesecloth and add to the pan. (You can substitute the apples with homemade or commercial pectin, if you'd prefer.) Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil, stirring from time to time, until the liquid is bubbling thickly and reduced, about 15-20 minutes. Remove the apples and discard or save for another use. Add the peach slices, lemon zest, and any accumulated juices to the syrup in the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture is bubbling thickly and the foam subsides, about 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir gently for a few seconds to distribute the fruit.
Can: (optional) Fill your hot, sterile jars to ¼"" headspace, remove any air bubbles, wipe the rims, put your lids on, and process for 10 minutes in the boiling water bath.

Slice your eggplant in half, arrange on a baking sheet and gently score the surface of the flesh. Brush with a little bit of olive oil and pre-bake your eggplant for a few minutes until the flesh starts to become tender. (8 mintues or so, depending on the size of your eggplant). Remove eggplant from the oven and turn your oven temp to ""broil.""
Meanwhile, make the glaze. In a small saucepan, combine the miso, mirin and sugar and bring to a gentle simmer. Whisk continuously until the sugar has dissolved and the glaze starts to thicken (2 minutes or so - barely bubbling). Remove from heat and let it cool (and continue to thicken) for a few minutes. Note - if you taste it at this point, it'll seem VERY salty - it will sweeten once the sugars caramelize on the eggplant under the broiler.
Liberally brush the glaze onto the eggplant. Broil until brown & bubbling (about 5-8 minutes). The amount of time will vary depending on the size of your eggplant and the strength of your broiler. Check after about 3 minutes.

For cutout cookies: roll onto a nonstick baking sheet (I rolled pine nuts into the top of my dough), until your dough is about ¼ inch thick.

Stir, and cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the kale is nicely wilted but still vibrant green. Remove from heat and set aside.
Mix the cooked kale with the white beans. Taste and adjust seasonings.
Assemble toasts with a baguette slice and a dollop of the kale and bean mixture. Top with the reserved rosemary, red pepper flakes, and a good shaving of parmesan. Taste one and adjust seasonings again — add more herbs if you wish, salt, pepper, or another squeeze of lemon if you like."

Sea salt and fresh black pepper","First, start your butternut squash: Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the butternut squash cubes and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook until they start to brown, gently flipping, to get color on the other sides, about 5 minutes. Before they start to brown too much, add the veggie broth and stir. Reduce heat to low. Cook until they are tender and cooked through, approximately 20 minutes. If the broth cooks down before they are done, add some more (or some water) to keep them from burning.
When the squash is at least half done, start your risotto: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, half the leeks, and a bit of salt and pepper. Cook until the onion is translucent but not browning, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic, stir, and cook for about 2 more minutes. Add the rice and mix it together with the onions so the dry rice toasts a little bit, about 1 minute. Add the wine, scrape up anything that’s sticking to the pan, and let the wine simmer down for another minute.
Add the broth 1 ladle at a time, stirring continuously. Each time the liquid cooks down, add another ladle full. Before you add the last ladle of broth, add the cooked butternut squash, the remainder of the leeks, a pat of butter, sage, rosemary, and grated cheese. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings.

2-3 scallions, white and green parts, chopped
2-3 cups low sodium vegetable broth
½ cup edamame, shelled and thawed
1 – 2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
Handful chopped basil
Handful chopped mint
Squeeze lime juice
Drizzle toasted sesame oil
Sesame seeds, for garnish
Extra-virgin olive oil
Crushed red pepper flakes or a splash of sriracha (optional)
Salmon (optional)","Prepare your noodles – if you’re using the shiratake noodles, they don’t need to be cooked, but drain and rinse them. They have sort of a funky smell, so I recommend shocking them in boiling water for 30 seconds. Then drain and rinse (again) in cold water. Set aside until you’re ready to use them.
In a large skillet (I used a stainless one where the sides of it are 4 or so inches high), splash a bit of olive oil. When it’s hot, add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they have wilted down, 5 or so minutes. Toss in the kale, ginger, garlic, and scallions. Sauté for a few minutes until the kale starts to wilt down but the garlic is not burning. Turn the heat down if garlic and ginger are starting to burn.
Add the broth, edamame, and noodles and simmer for a few minutes. If your veggies are soaking up all your broth, add more.
Turn off the heat and stir in the soy sauce, basil, mint, lime juice, and red pepper flakes, if using. Taste and adjust seasonings.
Ladle in to bowls and finish with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Top with cooked salmon, if using.
To cook the salmon: Season the fish with salt, pepper, and olive oil and press some sesame seeds on top. In a hot skillet, place the salmon, sesame seed side down, and sear so a light crust forms – 2 or so minutes. Some sesame seeds will fall off, that’s ok. Flip the salmon and continue cooking until it’s more (but not completely) opaque in the middle, about 4-6 more minutes. Serve on top of bowls of ginger noodles. Sprinkle with more sesame seeds if some have fallen off."

Place the peppers cut side open on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Bake for 15 minutes, or until they begin to soften.
Cook the couscous in a pot of salted boiling water until al dente (about 8-10 minutes). When it’s finished, drain and set aside. Toss it in a bit of olive oil so the little pearls don’t stick together.
In a large skillet over medium heat, pour a few splashes of olive oil and toss in the scallions, paprika, garlic, and pinches of salt and pepper. Stir a bit, then add the lemon zest and greens. Stir some more to let the greens wilt down a bit. Add a big squeeze of lemon juice and stir in the herbs, toasted pine nuts, currants, and red pepper flakes. Add the couscous. Mix together until the herbs and greens are just wilted and everything is combined. Taste and adjust seasonings. (If it’s a bit too bold and spicy at this point, that’s ok – once you bake it with the sweet peppers, the flavors will dial down).
Fill the peppers. If all of the filling doesn’t fit, it’s ok, just set the remainder aside and scoop it on top at the end.
Bake, uncovered, for about 10 -12 minutes. Alternatively, if you like your peppers much softer, cover them with foil and bake longer. I prefer my cooked peppers to still have a little bite. I pre-baked the peppers so the herbs in the filling wouldn’t burn – I find, unless you cover your stuffed peppers with a layer of cheese, grain fillings become a bit dry if cooked the entire way with the peppers.
Remove peppers from oven. Spoon on any of the remaining couscous mixture. Top with the yogurt sauce and any extra herbs.

Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Over medium-high heat, sauté the onion in the olive oil. Add a few pinches of salt. Add the garlic. When onions are translucent, add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, wine, and sugar. Reduce the heat. Simmer for 10 or 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more salt & pepper to taste (only if needed). Add the red pepper flakes, if using.
Remove the chard from ice water, squeeze out excess water, and chop.
In a large bowl, mix the cooked pasta, chard, cheese cubes, and tomato sauce.
Pour the mixture in a 9×13 pan. Sprinkle shredded parmesan cheese on top (if you like), and/or a drizzle of olive oil. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Broil for the last 1-2 minutes if you would like the cheese topping more brown and bubbling. (Note, if you’re not putting cheese on top, watch it more closely because it will dry out faster). Even without cheese on top, I prefer a bit of a crunchy crust. If you don’t, cook it less.
Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh chopped basil."

½ cup coconut oil","Preheat the oven to 375.
In a large bowl, mix the almond flour, oat flour, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, cranberries, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the carrots.
In a small bowl, whisk together the maple syrup & coconut oil. Pour into the carrot mixture and stir until just combined.
Drop 1-inch balls onto 2 cookie sheets. The dough will be very crumbly and be a little difficult to keep together, but that’s ok.
Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown."
1305,https://www.loveandlemons.com/sweet-potato-veggie-burgers/,"1 sweet potato, baked, peeled, and mashed
⅓ block of extra-firm tofu (from a 14 oz package)
1 tablespoon tahini
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon minced rosemary
1 teaspoon paprika
½ cup panko (to roll the patties in before baking)
Sea salt and fresh black pepper
Slider or regular hamburger buns
Whatever fixings you like on your burger: I had avocado, red onion & sprouts","Preheat the oven to 425.
Place the mashed sweet potato in a bowl and crumble in the tofu with your hands.
Mash together with a fork until the tofu falls apart even more.
Mix in the tahini, maple syrup, garlic, rosemary, paprika, salt & pepper.
Form into patties. They will be messy; that's ok.
Put the panko on a plate and coat the outside of each patty with the crumbs.
Place patties on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the edges are brown and crisp.
I turned the broiler on for the last 30-60 seconds to help the browning along.
You could also pan fry these in a skillet, but I baked them so they'd have less of a chance of falling apart.
Serve on buns with whatever fixings you like. Or serve without a bun over a mixed greens salad."

Grease a muffin pan (don’t ever use paper liners) and fill muffin cups almost to the top.
Bake for 5-8 minutes. Watch closely: the whole cake will puff up and they’re done a few seconds after you see the very center puff up. Remove from the oven. Place a baking sheet on top of your muffin pan and flip, holding both pans together. Gently lift up the muffin pan and shake it a little so the cakes release before the “lava” center breaks through the top (now bottom) of the cake. If that happens, it’s still ok, just try to shove the chocolate goo back up in the cake and place gracefully on a plate.
Scoop ice cream on top and serve."

When the kernels pop, remove the lid and pour in the remaining popcorn kernels. Cover and shake the pot, holding the lid on. Cook over medium heat, shaking the pot occasionally, until the popping sound stops after about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile melt the butter and stir the brown sugar into it. (this helps the brown sugar stick to the popcorn).
Pour the popcorn into a large bowl, drizzle on the melted butter and sprinkle in the curry powder, cayenne, and a good shake of salt."

½ teaspoon ground coriander
Pinch garlic powder
Pinch onion powder","Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Slice the corn tortillas into quarters and spread them on a parchment-lined baking tray. Sprinkle with salt, drizzle with olive oil, and toast them in the oven until crispy. Alternatively, use tortilla chips.
Make the cashew cheese: Soak the cashews in 1 cup water and set aside. Combine the agar and the remaining ¼ cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens.
Put the cashews and soaking water, tahini, garlic powder, onion powder, and lemon juice in a blender and puree. Add the agar mixture and blend for 3-5 minutes until the mixture starts to thicken. Salt to taste, and refrigerate the “cheese” while you assemble the rest of the nachos, allowing it to thicken while it rests.
Make the taco ""meat"": Combine the TVP, ½ cup water, soy sauce, olive oil, cumin, coriander, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and let sit for 10 minutes.
Make a quick guacamole by mashing the avocado with a squeeze of lime juice and a pinch of salt.
In a small bowl, combine the chopped tomato, onion, cilantro, and jalapeño with a squeeze of lime to make a pico de gallo. Salt to taste. (Store-bought pico works here too.) Assemble the nachos with the corn tortillas, cashew cheese, taco meat, quick guacamole, pico, scallions, and black beans."

¼ cup regular or light coconut milk

When the sweet potato is done, let cool slightly, peel, and cut into messy cubes. In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic, garam masala, and paprika and cook for one minute. Add the cooked potato cubes and the raw chopped pear and cook for two minutes more. Add the water, salt, sage, and cayenne. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-10 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to a large blender and puree, working in batches if necessary. Stir in the coconut milk, taste, and adjust seasonings. If it’s too thick, add more water. For a creamier soup, add more coconut milk.

Sherry vinegar or balsamic vinegar, for drizzling
Juice of ½ lemon, or to taste
Handful of watercress leaves, or arugula or microgreens
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
Flaky sea salt, optional","Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Place each beet on a piece of foil and drizzle generously with olive oil and pinches of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Wrap the beets in the foil and roast on a baking sheet for 35 to 60 minutes, or until soft and fork-tender. The time will depend on the size and freshness of the beets. Remove the beets from the oven, remove the foil, and set aside to cool. When they are cool to the touch, peel the skins. I like to hold them under running water and slide the skins off with my hands.
Use a citrus peeler to peel long strips around the orange, avoiding the white pith. Grated zest would work here also. Slice ¾ of the orange into segments and reserve the remaining ¼ wedge for squeezing.
Slice the beets into 1” wedges or chunks and place them in a bowl. If you’re using red and yellow beets, place each color into separate bowls so the red beets don’t stain the yellow beets.
Drizzle with olive oil and sherry vinegar, then add the lemon juice, orange juice squeezed from the remaining wedge, and a few pinches of salt and pepper and toss. Chill until ready to serve.
Taste before serving and season with more salt (flaky sea salt, if using) and pepper or more vinegar (for more tang), orange, or lemon juice, as desired.
Serve on a platter with the orange segments, watercress, and citrus curls."
